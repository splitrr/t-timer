#Scope creep
As a timer user i want another configurable option for notifications. This should integrate with the macos notification system so I can recieve alerts on hard coded events. Specifically that this point I wnat tio check the .pvm backupdirectory for how recent the backups are and send a notification if this is longer than 1 week.
